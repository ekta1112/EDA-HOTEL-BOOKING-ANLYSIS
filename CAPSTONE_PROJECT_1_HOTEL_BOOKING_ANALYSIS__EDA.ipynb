In this we divide data manipulation workflow in three category Data Collection, Data cleaning and manipulation and EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**. As Further moved i.e Data collections first step to find different columns which is done by coding Head(), tail(), info(), describe(), columns() and some other methods used for data collections, some of the columns name is updated here i.e hotel, is_canceled, lead_time, arrival_date_year, arrival_date_month, arrival_date_week_number, arrival_date_day_of_month, stays_in_weekend_nights. As we further move we find unique value of each columns and generate a list in tabular form and also check the dataset type of each columnsâ€™ find some columns not in accurate data types which correct it later done in Data cleaning part and as well as duplicates data items must be removed as **we find duplicates items equal to 87396 which is dropped from dataset later.**\n",
